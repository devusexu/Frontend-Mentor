### What I learned

I use grid for desktop layout this time, but I'm still not familiar with it.  
I think setting `repeat(3, 1fr)` for cards would span the spaces equally, while the truth is it becomes kinda weird like the screenshot below.

The reason is that 1fr is actually shorthand for `minmax(auto, 1fr)`  
It takes the *available* space.  
While I didn't set explicit width for this article container so there is no available space.  
The three cards will just use auto instead, which is the minimum width for the h2 title to fit in.   
For example I changed `Team Builder` to `TeamBuilder`, it took more space than supervisor now since all characters of a word needs to be on the same line.  
I also calculate the width of each card, they're all the width of the header plus left and right paddings, which means there are no extra spaces.
