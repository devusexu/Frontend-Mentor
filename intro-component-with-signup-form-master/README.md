## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Estimated time: 150 mins  
Result: far more by not being focused

In this challenge, I used these attribute about a11y
- aria-label
- aria-live
- aria-describedby  

label for interactive elements; live for constant changing area; describedby is just like labeledby but more detailed.

I suddenly realize the way I organize CSS is kinda hard to maintain.  
A MDN's article advise to split logical regions like general styles, utility classes, site-wide styles like layout, components, etc. but I don't write like that either so I don't benefit from the concepts actually. 

I also want to care less about pixel-perfection so that I won't spend that much time. I really want to reach the js/framework challenges more quickly, that's what matters to me.
