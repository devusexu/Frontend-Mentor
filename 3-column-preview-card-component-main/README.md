## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Always use CSS reset
2. 320px without horizontal scroll to meet WCAG level AA
3. You may not need to use media query(like the qr-code challange), with the help of max-width or grid auto-fill minmax, .etc.  
2. Use em/rem for media query
3. No explicit px for font-size
4. CUBE CSS, Utopia, progressive enhancement (still don't know how to implement)
8. Don't spend all of your time looking for best practices
4. CSS is complex

### Continued development

1. Semantics & a11y
2. Arrange CSS
