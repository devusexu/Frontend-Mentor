## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Estimate: 140 mins  
Reality: 219 mins
  - coding: 26 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 13 = 179 mins
  - writing docs & submit: 40 mins  

wat the hail, it takes so long! 



====================   

1. want flexbox row items to have same height => use grid instead
2. use [Accessible color palette generator](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator) to pick up similar colors for button interactive styles (it list the contrast too, cool!)
3. add ```overflow:hidden``` if border-radius doesn't work
4. use new elements for RWD image
    - figure
    - picture
5. almost forgot I use ```transition: all .2s ease-out;``` , it happens when property changes. Cool!

6. use ```del``` instead of CSS for deleted contents
7. no ```div``` in ```button```
8. caption need not have too much info but describing the main contents (e.g. the picture) => I put button outside of caption, wondering that if I need to put it outside of the figure too.





### Continued development

1. How to name color variables? primary, neutral, cornflower, ...?
2. When to use %? I use rem/em in most cases and px for margin/padding
3. I put everything in ```figcaption```, is that right? Because I think all of the information is about the picture, so they are all caption.
4. Is there too much explicit width? including max-width and max-height
4. Any better ways to write HTML & CSS: semantics, too many div?, class usage, CSS code refactoring
