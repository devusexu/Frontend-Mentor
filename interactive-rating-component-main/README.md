### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

To improve a11y, I add explicit border to focused state for both label and button.

Using `appearance: none` for radio input; input:checked style gone in Chrome but remained in Firefox.

Chrome:

Firefox(see the blue dot):

Other learning:
1. Tab into radio group then check different option using arrow keys
2. Using SASS might improve developer experience with the nesting feature, because I wrote CSS like this
```css
  .thank-you img {
    ...
  }

  .thank-you h2 {
    ...
  }

  .thank-you p {
    ...
  }         

```
3. Don't focus on pixel perfection with gap/padding/margin too much, focus on the implementation and learning


### Continued development

Should I use more classes or just use lots of combinators like now?
